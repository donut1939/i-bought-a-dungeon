<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Kill mobs in an endless dungeon (not endless yet, ran out of time).
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Fun and focused trying to get to the next level without dying.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A challege to see how far you can get in a dungeon before you die.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Dungeon crawler, rogue-like.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Story:</strong>
You are the main character who for some reason decided to buy a dungeon, but the dungeon is overrun with monsters, so he has to try to clear it out before he can make any use of it.  But he doesn't know how big the dungeon really is.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
WASD to move, left click to swing your sword and press 1 to generate a new map.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
My dungeon generation and mob control.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like Rogue-likes.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as you can live.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The game isn't hard yet, I still need to add a lot into it, but I have the framework running pretty well.  However there's not much strategy in it besides kiting currently.
</li>

<li><strong>Assets:</strong>
I made the character, enemy, and sword sprites.
Wall, floor, and dirt textures are from the DawnLike texture pack.  Which I modified for my needs.
</li>

<li><strong>Closest Phaser Example:</strong>
none.
